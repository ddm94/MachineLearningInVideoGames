# Machine Learning In Video-games
My Final Year Computer Science (Games) project at University of Brighton, UK. This is both an academic project as well as a private project and as such, the source code and all documentation related to the project are not available for view. However, a tailored report which fully describes the nature of the project can still be viewed here.
